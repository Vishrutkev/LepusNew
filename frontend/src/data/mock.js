  story: "Founded in 2018 with a vision to transform North American logistics, Lepus Group takes its name from the swift rabbit constellation that has guided travelers across the night sky for centuries. Just as ancient mariners relied on Lepus for navigation, today's businesses rely on us to navigate the complex landscape of modern logistics. Our founding team, comprised of industry veterans with over 100 combined years of experience, recognized the need for a transportation company that could combine traditional reliability with cutting-edge innovation. Starting with a modest fleet of 25 trucks, we've grown to become one of North America's most trusted logistics providers, handling over 125,000 loads annually while maintaining an industry-leading on-time delivery rate of 99.92%.",
